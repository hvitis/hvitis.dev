On this page you could see projects that I have developed over my career. Well, the one that stayed (there was more of it). The lesson is that the best software is software that people need. This is one of the most important reasons for me to work on any project, in any company. Yes, some enjoy coding on the balcony on Saturdays!

Here are some specific examples of my experience and skills:

As a developer, I have experience with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, React and Django. I am also proficient in a variety of testing tools and techniques, such as Selenium, Cypress, Postman and many more.

My main proffession (which I enjoy the most) is assuring quality of software. As a QA, I have experience developing and maintaining automated test suites for a variety of software applications. I am also skilled in using continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) pipelines to automate the software development process.

As a product owner, I have experience working with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, define user stories, and prioritize features. I am also skilled in using agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban to manage software development projects. I run a team of developers in my current company. I also have a private hobby project that is based on Kanban.

I am also a passionate reader and writer. That combination added to my software experience pushed me towards technical writing, which I enjoy very much. I have extensive technical knowledge, as well as writing and communication skills. Experience in book publishing (which is my biggest hobby) improved my organisational skills and taught me InDesign and Scribus software, that come in handy when preparing user's manual.

I also like LEGO (among other passions). If you have any idea regarding [Mosaic Art Maker](/mosaic-art-maker) or any other bussiness you can [just tell me](/contact).
