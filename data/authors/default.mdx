The best software is a software that people need. This is one of the most important reasons for me to work on any project, in any company. Well, I also enjoy coding on the balcony on Saturdays!

Here are some specific examples of my experience and skills:

As a product owner, I have experience working with cross-functional teams to gather requirements, define user stories, and prioritize features. I am also skilled in using agile methodologies such as Scrum and Kanban to manage software development projects. I run a team of developers in my current company.

Deep down, my core proffession is assuring quality of software. As a QA, I have experience developing and maintaining test matrixes and automated test suites for a variety of software applications. I am also skilled in using CI/CD pipelines to automate much of the SDLC.

As a developer, I have experience with a variety of programming languages and technologies, including Python, JavaScript, React and Django. I am also proficient in a variety of testing tools and techniques, such as Selenium, Cypress, Postman and many more.

I am also a passionate reader and writer. That combination added to my software experience pushed me towards technical writing, which I enjoy very much. I have extensive technical knowledge, as well as writing and communication skills. Experience in book publishing (which is my biggest hobby) improved my organisational skills.

Here I am trying to be best at owning a product, so I try to share book reviews of the best pieces written on managing.
