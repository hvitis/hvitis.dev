## Adding Tailwind CSS in 4 steps

Internet says you just need to follow [the official tutorial][1]. It's ALMOST true, except if you do only this, it won't work.

You need to follow those 4 steps:

1. Indeed follow the [official tutorial][1].

2. Delete all ionic CSS files except the core from App.tsx

```
/* Core CSS required for Ionic components to work properly */
import '@ionic/react/css/core.css';
```

3. Add the __tailwind.css__ file that contains:

```
@tailwind base;
@tailwind components;
@tailwind utilities;
```

4. Import this file in App.tsx

```
import './theme/tailwind.css';
```

Done !
