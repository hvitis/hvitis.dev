## How to Run Sudo Commands from Script without using Sudo

Let's say we have the following case:

On a remote serwer I have a command that requires admin privliges e.g. _systemctl_ command. I also have a script _restartservicess.sh_ that uses that command to restart some services. Now I want to execute this script using some user without elevated privliges during continuos integration process.

In order to do that, we need to exclude specific commands from the requirement of using elevated privliges. In order to do that we will add them to a file that is going to be added to __sudoers__ file. This file is located at:

```
/etc/sudoers
```

and at the end of this file we have default settings:

```
...
# Allow members of group sudo to execute any command
%sudo   ALL=(ALL:ALL) ALL

# See sudoers(5) for more information on "@include" directives:

@includedir /etc/sudoers.d

```

Which mean that all files from __sudoers.d__ will be added as extended permissions settings. Let´s create one file then. We __need to use visudo__ in order to do it:

```
sudo visudo -f /etc/sudoers.d/extended_permissions_for_restarting_services
```

In this file we will write:

```
yourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl restart gunicorn
```

Remember that the additional arguments to a command should be specified as a separate commands in order to include the exception e.g.:

```
yourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl stop gunicorn
yourusername ALL=NOPASSWD: /bin/systemctl start gunicorn
```

Now save the file and let´s go to our script _restartservices.sh_

What we had in the script:
```
sudo systemctl restart gunicorn
```

can now be changed to how our exception looks like:
```
#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Script run during ci
sudo /bin/systemctl restart gunicorn
```

Now when you log to your system using __yourusername__, you will be able to run:

```
bash restartservices.sh
```

Now the commands inside execute without entering password in the terminal. This is a complete solution to use nopasswd when you're stuck and it's not working.

This works every time on Ubuntu and any other debian based system.
